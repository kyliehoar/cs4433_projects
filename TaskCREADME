Code:
When I tried to write my original solution, I tried to create a mapper only solution, however I could not figure out how to effectively
create the solution. The newest solution includes a reducer. Once the mapper parses through the pages file, the reducer groups the countries and
it also merges the countries together. For example, if there are two canada facebook accounts, the output would be Canada 2 instead of listing Canada 1 twice.

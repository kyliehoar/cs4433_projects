Code:
My original solution included the mapper and reducer, however I realized that
there was a more efficient way to come to the solution and I didn't need a reducer.
This second solution is more scalable than my original solution because the cost is lower.
It costs more to add a reducer. The TA helped me with some of my code, helping me to set the file paths
and add in job.setNumReduceTasks(0).

Code:
There are two parts to this code. The first java file (accesslog) parses through the access_log.csv file and returns the top 10
facebook pages visited (figured out by WhatPage occurence) and how many times it was visited. The second java file (Top10) takes
both the output from the first file and information from pages.csv file to output the ID number, name, nationality, and how often
their facebook page was visited.
